<div class="content-body">

My name is Christian.  I am the Chief Technology Officer at [Roompact](https://roompact.com).  I studied Mathematics and Computer Science and Philosophy at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu).  I enjoy architecting software systems, designing and developing product features, and more generally, using technology to build things that people find useful.  I also find pleasure in working with functional programming and particularly the [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) programming language.  I am a die hard Linux user and have been running it on every single one of my computers since 2013. 

<a href="https://www.haskell.org"><img title="Haskell" src="/images/haskell_logo_signed.png" style="float:right; width:300px;"></a>

I always try to pay very strong attention to detail, expand my knowledge of computer science, and improve my understanding of software engineering as a whole.  I am not afraid to take time to learn a new technology or a new subject, particularly if it helps solve a problem I am working on.

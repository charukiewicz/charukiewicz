<div class="content-body">

My name is Christian Charukiewicz. I am a technology leader, teacher, and software engineer. I am a Co-Founder and Partner at [Foxhound Systems](https://www.foxhound.systems), a custom software development company that builds reliable, high-performance web applications. I'm passionate about both mentoring and learning from my teammates, leading the design and development of software products, and bridging the gap between the business and technology needs of an organization. My software design philosophy centers around creating value for end users. I am deeply interested in understanding the day-to-day problems people encounter, and how I can lead my team to create software that solves these problems.

I am an advocate of using functional programming for building real-world software systems. Professionally, I use the [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) programming languages, as well as [Nix](https://nixos.org/) for infrastructure management. I have extensive [first-hand experience](/posts/elm) using functional programming to build commercial software, as well as experience teaching programmers that have never used functional programming languages.

I studied Mathematics and Computer Science and Philosophy at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu/). I believe it is important for people to be well-rounded in their skills and knowledge. I believe that [reading is important](/reading), and that everyone should read at least a few books each year. Beyond technology, I am a culinary enthusiast and hobbyist photographer. I enjoy cooking, taking photos, writing, and sketching.

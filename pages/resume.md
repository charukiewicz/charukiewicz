**Partner & Principal Software Engineer** <span class="fr">Oct 2020 - Present</span><br>
Foxhound Systems 

Foxhound Systems creates software systems that inspire confidence and enable organizations to do their best work. We use a wide array of programming languages coupled with a variety of techniques such as SQL query optimization and database tuning to achieve superior reliability, performance, and design.

We recognize every project is different and are committed to using the right tools for each job. When performance, reliability, and maintainability are paramount, one of our specialties is using the Haskell programming language with the PostgreSQL database as we find this combination consistently drives excellent results, allowing us to achieve the excellent outcomes faster and with more consistency than by using any other approach.

- The package includes detailed documentation, use-case examples, and a suite of automated tests.
- See the [`isbn` package on GitHub](https://github.com/charukiewicz/hs-isbn).

**Yesod** *(Contributor)* - *The most popular Haskell web framework ([top 0.1% of all Haskell packages](https://hackage.haskell.org/packages/top))*

- Made improvements to the [yesod-auth](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/yesod-auth) Haskell package, enhancing the developer-facing API to enable more control over user registration and password reset workflows
- Improved developer-facing framework documentation

**Esqueleto** *(Contributor)* - *One of the most popular Haskell libraries for interacting with SQL databases ([top 0.1% of all Haskell packages](https://hackage.haskell.org/packages/top))*

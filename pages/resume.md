## Open Source Software

**isbn** *(Author)* - *Haskell library for validating and working with ISBNs*

- Authored the [isbn](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/isbn) Haskell package, which enables validating and manipulating [International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number).
- The package includes detailed documentation, use-case examples, and a suite of automated tests.
- See the [`isbn` package on GitHub](https://github.com/charukiewicz/hs-isbn).

**Yesod** *(Contributor)* - *The most popular Haskell web framework ([top 0.1% of all Haskell packages](https://hackage.haskell.org/packages/top))*

- Made improvements to the [yesod-auth](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/yesod-auth) Haskell package, enhancing the developer-facing API to enable more control over user registration and password reset workflows
- Improved developer-facing framework documentation

**Esqueleto** *(Contributor)* - *One of the most popular Haskell libraries for interacting with SQL databases ([top 0.1% of all Haskell packages](https://hackage.haskell.org/packages/top))*

- Ported elements of SQL into the [esqueleto](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/esqueleto) Haskell package, improving the package's coverage of SQL and helping developers avoid resorting to using prepared statements
- Wrote detailed documentation and examples for an experimental new syntax in the package, demonstrating usage of new package features and explaining design decisions

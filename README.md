Hi, I'm **Christian Charukiewicz**. I'm a software engineer, technology & product leader, teacher, learner, avid reader, and culinary enthusiast. I'm a Partner & Principal Software Engineer at [**Foxhound Systems**](https://www.foxhound.systems), a custom software development company that creates reliable, high performance web applications. We specialize in building with Haskell, Elm, and Nix.

### About me

- I've been programming since the mid-2000s, and started by writing IRC scripts and tweaking forum software.
- My favorite programming language is [**Haskell**](https://www.haskell.org/), my second favorite is [**Elm**](https://elm-lang.org/).
- I think **statically typed functional programming** results in a boon in developer productivity and leads to project success, and is something every programmer should learn.
- I'm a huge fan of **Linux** and run it on all of my machines, including my desktop and laptops.
- My favorite way of managing a system is using [**Nix**](https://nixos.org/), and I use it both personally and professionally.
- I read [at least one book each month](https://charukiewi.cz/reading/).

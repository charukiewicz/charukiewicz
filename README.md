Hi, I'm Christian Charukiewicz. I'm a software engineer, technology & product leader, teacher, learner, avid reader, and culinary enthusiast. I'm a Partner & Principal Software Engineer at [Foxhound Systems](https://www.foxhound.systems), a custom software development company that creates fast and reliable software systems. We specialize in using the Haskell and Elm programming languages coupled with a variety of techniques such as SQL query optimization and database tuning to achieve superior reliability, performance, and security.

### About me

- I've been programming since the mid-2000s, and started by writing IRC scripts and tweaking forum software.
- My favorite programming language is [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), my second favorite is [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/).
- I think statically typed functional programming is a boon to developer productivity and software quality. I think that it is something that every programmer would benefit from learning.
- I'm a huge fan of Linux and run it on all of my machines, including my desktop and laptops.
- My favorite way of managing a system is using [Nix](https://nixos.org/), and I use it both personally and professionally.
- I read [at least one book each month](https://charukiewi.cz/reading/).

### Open Source

- [**isbn**](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/isbn) *(Author)* - Haskell library for validating and manipulating ISBNs.
- [**yesod-auth**](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/isbn) *(Contributor)* - Haskell library for easy authentication in the Yesod web framework. I've made improvements to the developer-facing API to enable more control over the email-based user registration and password reset work flows.
- [**esqueleto**](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/isbn) *(Contributor)* - Haskell library for writing type-safe SQL queries. I've improved the library's coverage of SQL and also wrote detailed documentation and examples for its [new query DSL syntax](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/esqueleto-3.4.2.1/docs/Database-Esqueleto-Experimental.html).

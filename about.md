title: About
---

My name is Christian.  I am a software engineer at [Roompact](https://roompact.com).  I studied Mathematics and Computer Science and Philosophy at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu).  I enjoy developing algorithms and solving complex problems.  Currently, I am learning functional programming with [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and familiarizing myself with machine learning.  I have been running Linux on all of my computers for a couple of years now and I have been thoroughly enjoying it. 

I always try to pay very strong attention to detail.  I am always seeking to expand my knowledge of computer science and improve my understanding of software engineering as a whole.  I am not afraid to take time to learn a new technology or a new subject, particularly if it helps solve a problem I am working on.

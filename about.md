title: About
---

My name is Christian.  I am a software developer at [Roompact](https://roompact.com).  I studied Mathematics and Computer Science and Philosophy at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  I enjoy developing algorithms and solving complex problems.  I always try to pay extreme attention to detail.

I tend to be a generalist when developing my skills.  I am always open to diversifying my knowledge and learning new things.  I prefer to be well rounded and knowledgable in an array of different topics rather specializing in just a few.
